<h1>Minh An's personal web page :/</h1>

<h4>1. What is this website for?</h4>

<p>This website was made for people to learn a certain skill I have (Minh An's). This is also my summative assessment for IT class.</p>

<h4>2. Intoduction</h4>

<p>I was born on the 26th of May 2011. My mom and dad both died before I was 2, and I've been living with my grandparents ever since. I go to Saint Paul International School Hanoi, and I'm in grade 6. I really like learning and playing video games.</p>

<h3>3. One intresting thing I can do:</h3>

<p>I can do things really fast. I can play games very fast, I can shower very quickly, and I can cook dinner in 5 minutes. I can run very fast, I can click very fast, and I can drink very fast.</p>

<h3>4. How do you do things very fast?</h3>

<ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Skip a few steps </li>
        <li>Do things faster and more efficiently</li>
        <li>Skip things that are not needed</li>
        <li>Multitask</li>
    </ol>
</ul>

<h3>5. How to make and eat ramen really fast</h3>

<p>This section will show you how to make and eat lunch very fast.</p>

<p>*You only need 1$ and some skill to do this.</p>

<ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Go buy ramen. Don't buy the expensive kind. It takes long to make and doesn't even taste good</li>
<li>After you bring the ramen home, just leave it on the table and get a bowl</li>
<li>Get some hot water into the bowl, don't boil it with a pot though, because that takes a lot of time. Use your water machine with a hot mode or something.</li>
<li>Rip out your ramen pack and add the ramen and all the spices in the packet into your bowl. Take a pair of chopsticks to mix it.</li>
<li>Wait 10 seconds for it to be cooked. Then sit down and enjoy.</li>
<li>DON'T enjoy your ramen. Eat it real quick because it's what this entire section is about. Making and eating a quick lunch.</li>
    </ol>
</ul>
