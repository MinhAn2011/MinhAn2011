<h2>How to Sleep in Class</h2>
			<ol>
				<li> --- Choose a comfortable position.</li>
				<li> --- Find a quiet and dark corner of the classroom. Make sure you are behind a snitch or a teacher's pet.</li>
				<li> --- Don't use a pillow. It causes you to snore. Use a brick or your books.</li>
				<li> --- Don't cover your eyes. It will make the teacher become suspicious.</li>
