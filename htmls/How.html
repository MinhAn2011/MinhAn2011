<h2>How to Sleep in Class</h2>
			<ol>
				<li>Choose a comfortable position.</li>
				<li>Find a quiet and dark corner of the classroom. Make sure you are behind a snitch or a teacher's pet.</li>
				<li>Don't use a pillow. It causes you to snore. Use a brick or your books.</li>
				<li>Don't cover your eyes. It will make the teacher become suspicious.</li>
			</ol>
